# Total Recall
*Learn faces, so you can say hi to those faces when you're in places.*

**Total Recall** is a small game that shows you photos of your new friends, and prompts you for their name. 

## Quick Start

There's no need to clone down this repo in order to play! [**Click here to play Total Recall**.](http://tr.kyleshockey.com/)

## Using custom images

Total Recall uses an array of tuples, where `tuple[0]` is a character's name, and `tuple[1]` is an absolute URL to the character's photo. For best performance and presentation, use ~700x464 progressive JPEG images. [ImageMagick]() is great for making these transformations.
